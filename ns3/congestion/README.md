# ns3/congestion/ — Phase 3 (M3): finite queues + background congestion

Clean-room, permissively-licensed (Apache-2.0) proof that syncsim's M3
("congestion") scenario reproduces on ns-3, built on the Phase-1 `syncsim::Clock`
and the Phase-2/M2 gPTP mechanism (hardened in **P1a** — bounded PI servo +
missed-Sync handling + peer-delay outlier filter; see below). Reproduces
`simulations/congestion.ini`.

## The finding this phase reproduces

> **Congestion doesn't degrade sync globally — it degrades sync specifically for
> whoever shares the congested egress queue with the data traffic.**

Every switch port gets a finite, real-dropping `DropTailQueue` (`packetCapacity =
10`). Background data traffic (three ~50 Mbps flows) is offered onto the single
`swCore↔coreClient` 100 Mbps link — a guaranteed ~150-into-100 Mbps
oversubscription. gPTP Sync frames toward `coreClient` share that exact congested
egress queue, so `coreClient`'s sync degrades; no other node's gPTP path touches
that queue, so every other node is untouched.

## Why gptp/clock are vendored here

Same constraint every prior phase hit: ns-3's scratch build makes each
`scratch/<subdir>` an independent target and **cannot share a `.cc` across
sibling scratch subdirs**, and the Dockerfile is one `COPY ns3/congestion` line.
So `clock.{h,cc}` and `gptp.{h,cc}` are copied in **byte-identical** (confirmed by
`md5sum` against `ns3/nominal/` = `ns3/gptp/` = `ns3/feedback/`). The M3 data-plane
+ congestion machinery is entirely in the topology driver; the gPTP model is the
P1a-hardened `gptp.{h,cc}`, vendored identically across all four scenario dirs.

## How the coupling arises (the mechanism)

gPTP frames and data frames share the **same per-device CSMA egress queue**: both
are emitted via `NetDevice::Send()` on the same `CsmaNetDevice`, which owns one
finite `DropTailQueue` (Phase 0's proven drop mechanism). On the
`swCore→coreClient` device, three ~50 Mbps flows are offered onto a 100 Mbps link,
so that queue runs full and drops ~1/3 of everything in it. The gPTP Sync/Pdelay
frames `swCore` regenerates toward `coreClient` must sit in — or be dropped from —
that same congested queue, so `coreClient`'s Sync arrives late (extra unmodeled
queueing delay folds into `recvLocal − reconstructedGmTime`) or not at all (a
missed servo cycle). Every other switch egress carries only negligible gPTP, never
fills, and those nodes are untouched. **The asymmetry emerges from the shared-queue
mechanism — it is not hand-coded per node.**

## Simplifications (in addition to Phase-2's S1–S4, carried forward unchanged)

**S5 — background flows injected at their convergence egress.** The three flows
are offered on `swCore`'s `coreClient`-facing device directly, rather than
L2-forwarded hop-by-hop from `clientsA/B/C[0]` through `swA/B/C`. Reason: ns-3's
`CsmaChannel` is a single **shared CSMA/CD medium** (mainline ns-3.45 has no
full-duplex CSMA; a full-duplex `PointToPointNetDevice` was tried but its PPP
framer rejects the vendored gPTP ethertype `0x88b6`, and `gptp.cc` must stay
byte-identical). On a shared medium, 50 Mbps of transit data on a zone link
spuriously delays the **reverse-direction** gPTP Sync on that same medium — which,
confirmed empirically (a first hop-by-hop-forwarding attempt), coupled **every**
node's sync to the load and destroyed the isolation the finding is about (every
zone switch degraded to ~5 ms). INET's Ethernet links are **full-duplex**
(independent tx/rx), which is exactly why INET gets clean isolation. Injecting the
aggregate at the one genuinely oversubscribed egress reproduces the real
phenomenon — the shared bottleneck queue `coreClient`'s Sync competes in — without
the shared-medium artifact on transit links. The convergence, the oversubscription,
the real drops, and the shared-queue coupling all land exactly where
`congestion.ini` puts them: the `swCore→coreClient` egress. Zone links carry only
gPTP and are therefore isolated — INET's result.

## Result — **GATE PASS** (sandbox, ns-3.45, release build, asserts on)

`congestion-topology` exits `0`. **Deterministic**: byte-identical stdout across
two consecutive runs (`md5sum` matched). RNG use is the 12 seeded client drift
draws (drawn once, reused by both passes) + the seeded exponential inter-packet
timing.

The scenario runs **twice inside one process** — background OFF (baseline == M2
with finite queues but no data) then background ON — printing per-node peak
offsets side by side, so the isolation is a direct within-binary comparison.

30 s run, background window [1 s, 30 s], Sync 0.125 s, `meanGap` = exponential(160 µs).

### Bottleneck (swCore→coreClient egress, cap 10) under load

```
  data offered by 3 sources : 544018 pkts
  delivered to coreClient   : 366574 pkts (95.66 Mbps, 12640 pps)
  dropped at bottleneck     : 177634 pkts (32.64% of offered-into-queue)
  queue backlog             : mean 8.82/10, max 10/10
```

Compare INET's own M3 run (orientation only, **not** a match target): ~149 Mbps /
~18,759 pps at the bottleneck, ~34% drop, mean backlog 9.23/10. Our drop rate
(32.64%) and near-full backlog (8.82/10) reproduce the same regime. (Goodput
differs because our single 946 B frame size and injection point differ from INET's
full multi-app IP path; the **drop fraction and backlog** — the congestion
descriptors that matter — line up.)

**Every non-coreClient node's congested peak is byte-identical to its baseline
(ratio exactly 1.0x)** — total isolation, unchanged by the P1a servo hardening.
`coreClient` alone degrades, now by **21.2x** (was 2468x pre-P1a). `coreClient`'s
servo corrections drop **239 → 170** under load: real Sync frames were
dropped/starved from the congested queue.

### On the magnitude (24.08 µs → 510.47 µs vs INET's 1949.64 µs) — **fixed by P1a**

Pre-P1a this congested peak was **46,280.929 µs** — a 24x outlier over INET's
1,949.64 µs, the sole number the ns-3 track produced that was not trustworthy at
face value (`NS3_PARITY_PLAN.md` Tier 1). **P1a fixes it: the congested peak is
now 510.47 µs — below INET's 1,949.64 µs, the same order of magnitude, and it is
the genuine congested-queue Sync-delay signal rather than a servo/measurement
artifact.** The root cause and the fix, precisely:

1. **The old servo amplified missed Syncs (partial cause).** The Phase-2 servo
   (deadbeat phase + a fresh, unbounded `offset/elapsed` rate estimate each cycle)
   over-reacted when a Sync was sporadically dropped: the ballooned `elapsed` made
   its rate estimate briefly wild and the deadbeat phase rang on it. Hardening the
   servo to a **bounded, low-pass PI loop with missed-Sync skip** (P1a) cut the
   peak from 46,281 µs to ~20,500 µs — real, but only a ~2.3x improvement.

2. **The dominant cause was a corrupted peer delay, discovered during P1a
   verification.** With the servo loop stabilized, the residual ~20 ms peak traced
   to the measured link delay `d` inflating to **15–22 ms** — ~1000x its true
   ~2–3 µs value. Cause: the peer-delay handshake (`Pdelay_Req`/`Resp`) frames
   contend on the **saturated shared CSMA medium** (the S5 shared-medium artifact
   reaching the peer-delay path), so `t4 − t1` absorbs tens of ms of CSMA-backoff
   delay and `d = ((t4−t1) − (t3−t2))/2` reads garbage. A corrupted `d` feeds
   straight into `recvLocal − (originTs + upstreamCorr + d)` and injects a false
   offset that *any* servo, however well-tuned, faithfully chases. A **peer-delay
   outlier filter** (a running-minimum estimator — the true link delay is a
   physical floor, so contention can only ever *add*, and the ~20 clean
   pre-congestion Pdelay exchanges establish the floor) rejects the inflated
   samples. That takes the peak from ~20,500 µs to **510.47 µs**.

3. **What 510 µs *is*.** It is the real extra queueing delay a `coreClient`-bound
   Sync experiences waiting behind a near-full 10-packet bottleneck queue
   (10 × ~76 µs ≈ 760 µs, minus the fraction of Syncs dropped outright). That is
   exactly the M3 mechanism — the shared-queue coupling — now measured cleanly
   instead of being buried under servo ringing and peer-delay garbage. It stays
   **21.2x** its own baseline (clearly the one degraded node) and sits in the same
   ~hundreds-of-µs-to-low-ms regime as INET's 1,949.64 µs.

The isolation finding is untouched (all 16 other nodes still exactly 1.0x). Both
P1a changes live in the vendored `gptp.{h,cc}` and are documented in `gptp.h`'s
SERVO header block and the peer-delay filter comment; both are clean-room (public
linuxptp PI idea + a first-principles floor estimator, no ptp4l/INET source read).

## Gate checks (all PASS)

```
  [PASS] baseline (no traffic): every node still converges (|final| < 2 us)
  [PASS] congestion is real: bottleneck queue actually drops packets
  [PASS] coreClient sync degrades under load (21.2x its baseline, 510.471 us)
  [PASS] every OTHER node stays within 5 us of its baseline (isolation)
```

## What this does and does not establish

- **Does:** finite real-dropping queues (native ns-3, Phase 0's mechanism)
  reproduce the M3 congestion regime (~33% drop, near-full backlog) on the
  Nominal topology; and gPTP↔congestion coupling is **localized to the node
  sharing the congested egress queue** (`coreClient`), leaving all 16 other nodes
  at their exact M2 baseline. The core M3 finding reproduces.
- **Does not (deferred / simplified):** hop-by-hop L2 forwarding of the data
  (S5), full adaptive ptp4l-grade servo behavior (P1a hardens the loop to a
  bounded PI with missed-Sync skip + a peer-delay outlier filter, but not a full
  spike-rejection state machine), IEEE TLV wire format / pcap. Carries S1–S4
  forward unchanged; the gPTP model change is P1a's servo/peer-delay hardening.

### Honest licensing note

Same as every prior phase: the Apache-2.0 SPDX header covers our files' copyright
only. Because this links against ns-3 core (GPL-2.0-only), the **combined,
distributed binary is still GPLv2**.

### Not yet confirmed in real CI

Same caveat as Gates 0/1/2 / M2: no Docker daemon in this sandbox, so these
numbers are from a local ns-3.45 build. The `COPY ns3/congestion
"$NS3_ROOT/scratch/syncsim-congestion"` line (added this phase) picks these files
up automatically; verifying the containerized build is the standing step.
